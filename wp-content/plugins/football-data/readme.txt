Football Data displays live football scores, results, league table & upcoming fixtures for a whole competition/league or for teams.


== Description ==

The Football Data widget provides your site with a simple to install view of the latest results, league table and upcoming football fixtures for competitions and individual teams.

This football scores and soccer statistics widget is powered by data from http://www.turboscores.com and allows you to configure which of three info tabs that you would like your visitors to see as the first visible tab (choose either table/fixtures/results).

= Configuration options include: =


- Choose to display data for a competition, league or individual football team

- Adjustable width and height attribute of the widget

- Timezone offsets to show fixture times for your locale

- Language versions for English, French, German, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, Lithuanian, Albanian and Dutch

If you want to help with a language translation, please see the support section.

- The ability to link to detailed football data, statistics and more on http://www.turboscores.com


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.


1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Appearance->Widgets->Football Data screen to add the widget and configure options.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My language is not available, but I would like to translate it.  Can I contribute? =

Yes, you can.  Please visit the plugin support page (https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/football-data) and reply to the monitored thread: “**LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS**”


= What changes can I make to the appearance of the widget? =

You can control the height and width of the widget to suit your sidebar (within some minimum and maximum restrictions).  You can also determine which tab (fixtures,results, table) that you want to display as the default first tab.


= What about using the plugin to add to the main part of a page or post? e.g. via a shortcode =

Whilst it’s not specifically set up for a shortcode at the moment, you can try a workaround using https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-shortcode/ to generate a shortcode for it.

= Are there other restrictions? =

There is a limit to the number of instances that the widget can be shown on a single page or post. You can have up to three instances on each page, as long as you make sure that the ‘first tab shown’ is different in each case.


For example, to get up to 3 instances of the widget on a page/post, one will need to show the fixtures as the first tab shown, one will need to show the results as the first tab shown, and the other will have to show the table as the first tab shown.
